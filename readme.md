## Application Summary: In this demo, the user has signed up for a trade show and will be volunteering for a day or night shift on behalf of their company.

## Application Features: This app showcases several Gmail Add-Ons features, including multi-card navigation, form input retrieval with persistent state (user props storage), and a “confirm” button that prints user data as a canned email response.

## Application UI: The application consists of two cards (shown below) with a Universal Settings icon (triple dot) in the header for navigation.

## Application UX: selects a company that they work for, which causes an employee list to appear in the dropdown menu. These settings are saved and the user navigates to a new card where they can choose to volunteer for a day or night shift. When finished, they confirm and the Add-On will create an email reply with canned response.
